# HTTP API reference

The loop generator and router run as a FastAPI service on top of a local
Valhalla instance. Start it with:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

Interactive docs live at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc`. Configuration is
read from the environment (or a `.env` file): `VALHALLA_URL`,
`VALHALLA_ELEVATION_DIR`, `CORS_ORIGINS`.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | Service status and version |
| POST | `/api/v1/loops` | Circular route from an origin, with distance/gain targets |
| POST | `/api/v1/routes` | Point-to-point route through ordered waypoints |

All endpoints return JSON. Route geometry comes as an **encoded polyline**
(`polyline` field, [polyline6](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility)
precision, 1e-6): a compact string that map libraries (Google Maps Geometry,
Leaflet, Mapbox, `mapbox_polyline`/`polyline` packages) decode directly into
lat/lon points.

## GET /api/health

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/api/health
```

```json
{"status": "ok", "version": "0.2.0"}
```

---

## POST /api/v1/loops

Generates a closed loop from an origin. Waypoints are placed on a ring,
routed through and re-scaled until the requested distance and elevation gain
are met; if the targets cannot be met from that origin the best-effort loop
is returned with `feasible: false`.

Request:

```json
{
  "origin": {"lat": 40.5964, "lon": -3.6318},
  "distance_km": 70,
  "gain_m": 900,
  "via": [{"lat": 40.7917, "lon": -3.9635}],
  "tolerance": 0.05,
  "gain_tolerance": 0.20,
  "waypoint_count": 10,
  "max_iterations": 8
}
```

Only `origin` and `distance_km` are required.

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/loops \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"origin":{"lat":40.5964,"lon":-3.6318},"distance_km":70,"gain_m":900}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "distance_km": 68.84,
  "gain_m": 922.20,
  "loss_m": 921.34,
  "feasible": true,
  "iterations": 3,
  "polyline": "u{~fFswjsC`Ay@aE...",
  "score": {
    "comfort": 64.37,
    "paved_share": 0.45,
    "surface_km": {"dirt": 36.44, "paved_smooth": 29.86},
    "climb_load_m": 964.76,
    "max_grade_pct": 24.0
  }
}
```

- `feasible`: targets met within tolerance (`false` = best-effort result).
- `score`: quality metrics from Valhalla edge data; `null` when scoring is
  unavailable. `comfort` is 0-100 distance-weighted surface quality,
  `paved_share` the fraction on paved surfaces, `climb_load_m` the
  vertical-equivalent meters of positive grade and `max_grade_pct` the
  steepest upward grade found.

---

## POST /api/v1/routes

Point-to-point bicycle route through ordered waypoints (2 to 20).

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/routes \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"waypoints":[{"lat":40.4168,"lon":-3.7038},{"lat":40.7850,"lon":-3.9600}]}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "distance_km": 74.12,
  "gain_m": 1053.50,
  "loss_m": 988.20,
  "polyline": "u{~fFswjsC`Ay@aE...",
  "score": {"comfort": 71.2, "paved_share": 0.83, "...": "..."}
}
```

Gain/loss are computed locally from Copernicus DEM tiles; `score` carries the
same quality metrics as loops.

## Errors

Every error answers with the same JSON shape:

```json
{"error": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "human readable", "details": {}}
```

| Status | `error` | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Request body fails schema validation |
| 422 | `ROUTING_ERROR` | Valhalla cannot route through the given points |
| 503 | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | Valhalla unreachable |
